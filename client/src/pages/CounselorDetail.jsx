Maybe he figured it was time to stop diagnosing viruses and start dealing with the mosquito kind. Either way, he's ready to bring his scientific precision, medical expertise, and coding finesse to the great outdoors. Let's just hope he knows how to start a campfire!",

He's always flashing that pearly-white, almost-perfect smile of his, which some might suspect is just a veneer he bought with all that cash. But little do they know, Gokhan is secretly a YouTube sensation, posting videos of himself scarfing down kebaps and making it rain cash on unsuspecting strangers. He used to be a web developer, but now he's a camp counselor, because apparently nothing brings him more joy than watching kids try to catch fireflies while he eats his weight in lamb skewers. Gokhan's motto in life? 'Money can't buy happiness, but it sure can buy a lot of kebap.'",

His power always goes out, leaving him stumbling around in the dark like a confused moose. But fear not, for Brandon is here to save the day! With his trusty flashlight and his boundless enthusiasm, he'll keep your kids entertained and your campsite well-lit (as long as he doesn't accidentally bench-press the generator). So come on down and meet Brandon, the man who's always in the dark but never out of energy!",

She's lowkey married to Gokhan, which is like being highkey married, but without the pressure of constantly updating your relationship status on Facebook. As a nervous presenter, Joana always brings a new level of excitement to any presentation. Her voice might shake and her palms might sweat, but she never fails to keep her audience on their toes - mostly because she's on her toes, trying not to faint. Despite being a web developer in a past life, Joana has recently made the career switch to camp counseling. She loves spending her days in the great outdoors, teaching kids how to make s'mores and avoid poison ivy. And let's not forget about Joana's ultimate goal - she wants to have 100 babies! Yes, you heard that right. 100 little bundles of joy running around her house, all calling her 'mom'. We're not sure how she plans to achieve this feat, but we're rooting for her all the way.",

Don't be surprised if he designs a website for the campfire songs and s'mores!",

He's a former cop who's seen it all, a philosopher who can wax poetic about the meaning of life, and a web developer who can code circles around anyone. But despite all that, he's decided to ditch the tech world and embrace the great outdoors as a camp counselor. He's traded in his badge for a whistle and his computer for a compass, but don't worry, he's still full of witty one-liners and philosophical musings. So come on down to Camp Tyler and prepare to have your mind blown (and maybe a few s'mores too).",

With a bushy mustache that could make Tom Selleck jealous, Vincent knows how to keep his upper lip warm during those chilly mornings in the great outdoors. But don't let his love for Starbucks fool you, he can brew a mean pot of coffee over an open fire. He may have swapped his keyboard for a compass, but Vincent is still the king of coding - he can debug a tent faster than you can say 'HTML'. So if you need a web developer who can also lead a game of capture the flag, Vincent's your man!",

But don't be fooled by his tech prowess, because when it comes to ice cream, he's just a big kid at heart. In fact, he loves the frozen treat so much that he once coded an entire website just to showcase his favorite flavors! Now, Mike is taking on a new challenge as a camp counselor. Will he be able to handle the chaos of campfires and s'mores, or will he retreat back to his coding cave with a pint of Rocky Road? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for the next chapter of Mike's hilarious adventures!",
